Hi there!

This week we worked on our use case specification. We chose some of our use cases and added all the necessary details to it. This includes a text based description of the use case and a basic description of the activity flow, but also a mockup of our user interface and an activity diagram. If you want to take a closer look at our work, we have linked the use case specification down below, feel free to have a look at them.
Just as the SRS, these use case specifications are living documents, so don't be surprised if you come across a "TODO" in these documents :-).

- [Use case: fill out user profile](https://github.com/DHBW-Experts/documents/blob/main/UseCases/use_case_Fill-out-user-profile.md)

- [Use case: edit skilltag](https://github.com/DHBW-Experts/documents/blob/main/UseCases/use_case_Edit-skilltag-in-user-profile.md)

- [Use case: find users by skilltag](https://github.com/DHBW-Experts/documents/blob/main/UseCases/use_case_Find-others-by-skilltags.md)

- [Use case: validate email address](https://github.com/DHBW-Experts/documents/blob/main/UseCases/use_case_Authenticate-Email.md)

## Wireframes

We decided to use [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) to create our UI Wireframes. They offer a variety of premade ui components, that you can then arrange and customize to your needs.
The results can be seen in the use case specifications linked above.
Lukas will take those wireframes to create a more refined mockup.

## User interface

This week we began with the actual development of our product. We started to build a user interface that allows the user to register an account. This way we were able to get some basic understanding of our [frontend framework](https://ionicframework.com/) of choice and its structure.

## Database API

As described in our [last blogpost](https://dhbw-experts.github.io/blog/03/), we also began development on our backend api which will connect our mobile application to our database. Some of the implemented functionality includes registering a user and finding a user by their ID.
