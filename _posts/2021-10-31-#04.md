Hi there!

This week we worked on our use case specification. We chose some of our use cases and added all the necessary details to it. This includes a text based description of the use case and a basic description of the activity flow, but also a mockup of our user interface and an activity diagram. If you want to take a closer look at our work, we have linked the use case specification down below, feel free to have a look at them.
Just as the SRS, these use case specifications are living documents, so don't be surprised if you come across a "TODO" in these documents :-).

- [Use case: fill out user profile](https://github.com/DHBW-Experts/documents/blob/main/use_case_Fill-out-user-profile.md)

  This use case includes filling out a user profile when creating an account on the one hand and editing a user profile once an account has been created on the other hand. These two require the same user interface and very similar logic.

- [Use case: verify email address](https://github.com/DHBW-Experts/documents/blob/main/use_case_Authenticate-Email.md)

## Mockups

We decided to use [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) to create our UI mockups. They offer a variety of premade ui components, that you can then arrange and customize to your needs.
The results can be seen in the use case specifications linked above.

## User interface

This week we began with the actual development of our product. We started to build a user interface that allows the user to register an account. This way we were able to get some basic understanding of our [frontend framework](https://ionicframework.com/) of choice and its structure.

## Database API

As described in our [last blogpost](https://dhbw-experts.github.io/blog/03/), we also began development on our backend api which will connect our mobile application to our database. Some of the implemented functionality includes registering a user and finding a user by their ID.
