Ahoi,

instead of working as it should and letting us get on with our work, our app decided to rip itself apart and threw a ton of colorful error logs. After just 5 hours of research and many failed attempts, we managed to fix everything and were ready to go on.

The framework which was resposible for the dilemma is Ionic in combination with Angular. It is TypeScript based and supports CRUD. Unfortunately, there is no way to auto-generate CRUD and we have to implement it manually (which luckily doesn't take much time :) ).

For our class diagram we used the VSCode extension classdiagram-ts by AlexShen.

Last but not least our Software Architecture Document can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/DHBW-Experts/documents/blob/main/SAD.md) too.
