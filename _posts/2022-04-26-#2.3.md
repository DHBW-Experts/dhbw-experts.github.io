Hey Mate!

This week we tried to make sure that we correctly estimate the time it takes us to implement our different Use-Cases. Although it would have been possible to estimate the workload based on the Lines of Code, we have to write to implement a feature, we decided to calculate function points for every use case instead. That way our estimation is based on a functional perspective on the Use-Case instead of being completely abstract. 
The calculation is based on the following parameters:

- Number of User Inputs
- Number of User Outputs
- Number of User Inquires
- Number of Files
- Number of External Interfaces

Instead of performing the calculation manually we used the following calculator to determine the function points: [link](http://groups.umd.umich.edu/cis/course.des/cis525/js/f00/harvey/FP_Calc.html?tCountVal=0#FPCalc)

After we calculated the function points for every use case, we determined if our estimation correlates with the actual time, we spent to implement our Use-Cases in the last semester. To picture the connection, we used a scatter plot with points for every Use-Case of the 3rd Semester.

![Graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHBW-Experts/documents/main/FunctionPointCalculation/FP-Graph-3rd-Semester.png)

As you can see in the graph, the time we spent on every Use-Case more ore less correlates with the estimation we made. Only the register-Use-Case is estimated way to high. The reason for that is that we only implemented a temporary registering solution last semester. As we start to implement our real registering solution this semester, the Use-Case will move farther to the right and start to correlate with out estimation.
With the help of some Excel magic we calculated the following metrics for our project:

- Time and FP correlate with a correlation-coefficient of 0.78 (good!)
- Every FP corresponds to 1.1 hours of work 

Disclaimer: There is no time spent on the delete-User-Use-Case as the admins can delete Users by removing their entry on the database.
