In our first content-related blog entry we will present our project idea. As you may have already noticed, our project is called "DHBW-Experts".
The very basic idea is to create an easy way for students to find experts concerning a specific subject.
We want to create an app, which will enable our users to create a profile, where one can link any certain topic, they are an Expert in.
This will be possible by adding hashtags (e.g., #C++ or #BWL, although you can add non-DHBW-related tags like #csgo or #Tax too) alongside their DHBW-related personal information to their student profile. These tags can be searched by anyone needing help, creating an expertise-database.

Nowadays, almost every smartphone can scan NFC-Chips and we think it is possible to link more information to the NFC-Chip than just your cafeteria balance. This is why we want to encourage our users to voluntarily link their RFID student ID card to our app to create their own digital business card - Just scan someoneâ€™s ID with our app and get an overview of who you are dealing with. Find out what they are good at and enjoy an instant conversation starter.

Our app should be available as an Android and iOS-app (Although it will be almost impossible to deploy without an Apple Developer account) using Ionic. Ionic allows you to develop an application that works flexible on iOS, android and pcs.

Feel free to give us some feedback on our idea!
