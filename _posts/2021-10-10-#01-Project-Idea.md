Blog Entry 01 - the Project idea

In our first content-related blog entry we will present to you our project idea. As you may have already noticed, the project is named "DHBW-Experts". The whole project builds up around this name. 
The very basic idea is to create an easy way for students connecting each other. Especially a way of getting to know people that are experts in any subject. It has not even need to be a subject that's taught at the DHBW, so e.g. a specific programming language or data structures. 
This will be possible due to adding hashtags(e.g. #C++ or #MySQL) to his ID from the student identification card. Nowadays, almost every smartphone can scan NFC-Chips and we think it is possible to add some more information to the NFC-Chip in the card than just the ID.

The Usage later on will be very easy, we plan to develop it as an android and also ios-app by using ionic. Ionic allows you to develop a programm that works flexible on ios, android and mostly also on the pc. 
Once this is implemented as planned, students on the campus will be able to scan easily others student ID-card (of course with their permission) in case they need some help with e.g. a project and then they know instantly what the student infront of them can do best. 
This way, you might find help easier if needed.
