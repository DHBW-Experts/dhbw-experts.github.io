Howdy!

This week we will present you rather little text and more visuals: statistics and app designs!

# Project Statistics

As required by this week’s lecture we created some interesting diagrams on YouTrack to track the progress we make on our project.

The Diagrams should be rather self-explanatory, so have a look! Feel free to ask questions and give us feedback if you can think of something we could add.

You can find our Dashboard either on our [YouTrack project landing page](https://dhbw-karlsruhe.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/projects/a083958c-208a-4101-ae18-0a908553b15d) or on its dedicated site [here](https://dhbw-karlsruhe.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/dashboard?id=f7adb58a-d837-4096-9bb0-dd0ca3529ab0).

# App Designs

Luckily, I have access to [Adobes UI/UX-Design Tool Xd](https://www.adobe.com/de/products/xd.html). Although was quite hard to get everything to work, I managed to create some clickable models of our UI. Fortunately, those models are even exportable in HTML and CSS which should make them rather simple to implement in Ionic: wish us luck!

Although I would have loved to publish the clickable models for you to try, my Adobe Plan won’t let me do that, so I threw in some screenshots down below. We are excited for your thoughts and feedback!
