G'day mate,

today I want to talk about how we use metrics and the associated tools to detect problems in our code and measure our improvement. We have decided to use sonarcloud for our metric analysis (you can find our dashboard [here](https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=DHBW-Experts_app)). After some work, we were able to integrate sonarcloud into our workflow. We have set it up in the following way: on every pull request, sonarcloud will automatically analyze the new code and give you an overview. It looks like this:

We have decided to work on cyclomatic complexity and cognitiv complexity. Cyclomatic complexitiy measures how many possible paths are there through a certain piece of code. The higher the cyclomatic complexity, the more test you will have to write. Cognitiv complexity determines how tricky a unit of code is to understand. This is important for everyone that will have to read and modify the code in the future.

After letting sonarcloud crunch some numbers for us, we took a look at the metrics. The first thing we noticed is not really surprising: the bigger the file (in terms of lines of code), the bigger cyclomatic and cognitiv complexity. One thing that stood out however was our the class that mocks our api wrapper. When creating it, we basically copy and pasted our existing api wrapper class and modifying the necessary methods. After we were done with the tests, we simply forgot about this class. This means that there was a lot of code in that class that was never called, basically every api endpoint that does not appear in our tests. Another thing we noticed is our error handling. Whenever there is a connection error there will be a popup. This is not required in our mock, since it does not actually make a network connection. We removed all of the code that handles connection errors in our mock. While we were at it, we also decided to remove a lot of unused imports with a vs-code shortcut. After we were done, our mock was a lot shorter and better to understand. Our improvements in case of numbers looks like this:

cyclomatic complexity: 323 -> 316

cognitiv complexity: 59 -> 52

All of the changes we made can be found in this [Pull Request](https://github.com/DHBW-Experts/app/pull/35):

We expected some problems in other files as well, but it seems like our refactoring work in the last few weeks worked at least to some extent.

Another class with one of the higher cyclomatic complexity in our code is our actual api wrapper. It has a cyclomatic complexity of 22. There is not much that we can do about that, since that is exactly the number of methods in the wrapper. Every method makes a request to a different url to retrieve certain data.
