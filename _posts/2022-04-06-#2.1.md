Welcome back again to the 2nd half of our project 'DHBW-Experts'. In the first week we got us an overview of our project so everyone is still aware of everything! Furthermore we thought about our scope for the 2nd semester and decided that we don't need to change anything.
As we went through our project code, we also thought about our distribution of all tasks that are still open. The task distribution in the first few weeks will look like the following:
- Ralph: programmer for typescript and the UI
- Tim: joining Ralph in coding
- Lukas: developing our backend and the database
- Noah: also coding and fix the configuration of the project, so everyone can deploy it on his local computer

Of course this might change during the semester, but for now that's it.
To get started, we then created our first tickets in 'YouTrack' and started the sprint. 

See you next week, stay tuned!
