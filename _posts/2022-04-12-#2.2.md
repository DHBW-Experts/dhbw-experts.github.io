Hi everyone,

This week, we took a look at possible risks we might face in our future development process. The following screenshot shows a table with these risks, their probability of occurrence and the resulting damage, how we can prevent them and who the expert is in an emergency. The last column shows the risk factor we calculated to identify the greatest risks.

As you can see, the biggest risks (we lose a team member or decide to change the tech stack) both received a risk factor of 12, resulting from a fairly low probability of occurrence combined with a very high resulting damage. In contrast, the smallest risks (a bug in the database or application) received a very low risk factor of 0.8, resulting from a pretty high probability of occurrence combined with a very low resulting damage. In general, risks with a low risk factor are the most likely to occur, while those with a high factor are very unlikely.

Are there any risks that you think we have forgotten? If so, feel free to share them with us.
