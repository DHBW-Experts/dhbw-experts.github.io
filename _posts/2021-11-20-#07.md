Hello everyone,

this week we will present to you our class diagram, since we already got a db-scheme earlier. Anyway, you can still take a look at it again.

# Class Diagram

We created a class diagram containing five classes with their attributes and methods. Also the data type is always given. While creating theses classes we tried to use our [use cases](https://dhbw-experts.github.io/blog/04/) as an orientation.

However, the class diagram might change in the future, because we didn't implement many classes yet. If you have any questions according the content or the structure, let us know!

# Data base scheme

Our data base scheme was already shown in [blog post 03](https://dhbw-experts.github.io/blog/03/). If you haven't read it already, be sure to check this blog post in order to get all the details about our ER-Diagram. If you still have any questions or improvement suggestions, let us know!
