Hello everyone,

this week, we will take a step back and evaluate our team work and the progress we have made so far.

Let's start off with the positive things: what things have been proven to work great so far?

- working backend infrastructure that can handle the basic tasks that our application will need
- clickable app designs that can be exported to HTML and CSS
- working database
- partially working CI/CD

Now on to the things that don't work yet and need to be improved upon:

- distribution of roles and responsibilities
- overly ambitious scope for the first semester
- difficulties with new language

How do we plan on improving?

- we will be more concrete about distributing roles in our team. For the next semester, we also plan to implement end-to-end responsibility
- we will rework our scope and set more realistic goals that we can achieve in the remaining time in the first semester (Lukas from the future here: everything worked out as scheduled in the end of the first semester, so no need to wory :) ) 
- there's not that much we can do about typescript being a little difficult for firsttimers, other than just spending more time with the language and getting familiar with it

all of these details were elaborated during the retrospective and in collaboration with another group.
