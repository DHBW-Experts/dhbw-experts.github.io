Welcome!

Our Blog is up and running and this will be the place where we want to keep you up to date. We use GitHub-Pages with jekyll as our backend to compile ready to use HTML sites. As our comment-backend we use utteranc.es: Every comment you write will be stored as a GitHub Issue in our Blog Repo. This is also the reason why we need you to log in with a GitHub account to be able to write comments.
