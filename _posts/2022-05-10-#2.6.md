Servus, Gr√ºezi und Hallo,

This week everything revolves around the topic of refactoring aka. making our code easier to read, understand, maintain and extend. Luckily, our IDE (Visual Studio Code) offers many features to support us in this task.

First of all, like most IDEs, VS Code can easily rename classes, variables and functions with all of their occurrences in the code.

Second, it gives us suggestions to extract specific parts of methods, functions etc. in case they are to long or complex.

Last but not least, there is a ton of extensions which add further refactoring features for almost every programming language you can think of.
